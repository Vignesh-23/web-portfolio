## Use of AI
- Claude Opus was used to make the star constellation in the landing page.
- Prompt: Design a landing page, in index.html
My name should be in italics and the links to the aboutMe and ContactMe pages should be below it. For the background should be like a star constellation which is moving.
Only give the index.html, styles.css and script.js for this part alone.
